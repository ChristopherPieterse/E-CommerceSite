# E-CommerceSite
E-Commerce site developed with a team where I was the leader and main coder/only designer.
There is no code here, just a link to the github repo where the code resides. The project was not polished for selling, but all the functionality is functioning. My main contribution to the site was the custom PC builder which allows the user to input their budget and what they would like to do with their computer and help them create a PC suited for them.
